## 🤖 Agents

Agents are specialized sub-agents that can be explicitly invoked during your Claude Code sessions to perform specific tasks.

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **code-reviewer** | Performs systematic code review analyzing security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, auth issues), performance problems (N+1 queries, algorithmic complexity), bugs (race conditions, null references), and maintainability concerns. Returns structured feedback with severity levels and concrete fixes. |
| **commit-writer** | Reads the working tree diff, classifies every changed file, stages the right set, and writes a structured commit message (title, description, max 3 detail lines of 10-15 words). Splits mixed working trees into separate logical commits and blocks secrets from being staged. |
| **debugger-assistant** | Analyzes error messages, stack traces, and logs to identify root causes. Provides debugging strategies for common patterns like race conditions, memory leaks, async issues, and null references. Suggests concrete next steps. |
| **refactor-wizard** | Guides safe, incremental refactoring with impact analysis. Detects code smells (duplication, long functions, deep nesting), suggests classic refactoring patterns, and ensures tests pass at each step. **Critical: Refactoring must NOT change behavior.** |
| **security-auditor** | Identifies OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, injection attacks, broken access control, cryptographic failures, and insecure dependencies. Provides concrete remediation code examples. **Must be used before production deployments.** |
| **test-writer** | Generates comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests with edge cases, mocks, and fixtures. Analyzes coverage gaps and suggests missing test scenarios. Follows TDD best practices. |

## 🎯 Skills

Skills are activated automatically based on task relevance, providing domain expertise when needed.

### Development & Code Quality

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **api-design** | Design consistent, maintainable REST and GraphQL APIs with proper versioning, error handling, and documentation. Apply when creating new APIs or refactoring existing ones. |
| **code-review** | Perform thorough code reviews focusing on correctness, maintainability, performance, and best practices. Apply when reviewing pull requests, auditing code quality, or mentoring developers. |
| **debugging-methodology** | Systematic debugging methodology to efficiently identify and fix bugs. Apply when encountering unexpected behavior, errors, or performance issues in any codebase. |
| **git-commit** | Analyze changed files, stage them, and write a structured commit message describing the actual changes. Apply when committing work, writing commit messages, or splitting a messy working tree into clean commits. |
| **performance-optimization** | Optimize application performance through profiling, benchmarking, caching, and resource management. Apply when addressing slow response times, high memory usage, or scalability concerns. |
| **refactoring-methodology** | Safely refactor code using proven patterns to improve structure without changing behavior. Apply when improving code quality, reducing technical debt, or making code easier to extend. |
| **test-strategy** | Create comprehensive testing strategies using the testing pyramid. Apply when writing tests, planning test coverage, or setting up testing infrastructure for any codebase. |

### Architecture & Infrastructure

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **database-design** | Design efficient database schemas with proper normalization, indexing, and query optimization. Apply when creating new databases, optimizing queries, or planning data migrations. |
| **devops-cicd** | Design and implement CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment strategies. Apply when setting up automation, improving deployment processes, or implementing infrastructure as code. |

### Frontend & UI

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **frontend-design** | Creates minimalistic, production-grade frontend interfaces using shadcn/ui with themes from tweakcn.com. Apply when building React components, landing pages, dashboards, or any frontend UI work. |

### Security & Documentation

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **security-audit** | Perform security audits using OWASP Top 10 principles. Check for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication issues, and other vulnerabilities. Apply when reviewing code or building security-sensitive features. |
| **technical-writing** | Write clear, comprehensive technical documentation including READMEs, API docs, architecture decision records, and onboarding guides. Apply when creating or updating any project documentation. |

### Utilities

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **docs-lookup** | Get up-to-date documentation for any library, framework, or technology using Context7 and Brave Search MCP servers. Apply when you need current API references, migration guides, or best practices. |
| **gemini-subagent** | Use Gemini CLI as a sub-agent to brainstorm ideas, get feedback, plan implementations, and perform code reviews. Apply when you need a second perspective or alternative approach. |

## 🔗 Installation via Symlinks

Symlinking allows you to keep your Claude Code configuration always in sync with this repository. Any updates to skills or agents in this repo will automatically be reflected in your Claude Code environment.

### Why Symlink?

- **Always up-to-date**: Pull latest changes and they're immediately available
- **Single source of truth**: Manage skills and agents in one place
- **Easy versioning**: Use git to track and revert changes
- **Shareable**: Team members can use the same configuration

### Prerequisites

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arshshtty/skills.git
   cd skills
   ```

2. Locate your Claude Code configuration directory:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `~/.claude/`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\`

### Symlinking Instructions

Choose the appropriate method for your operating system:

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Navigate to your Claude Code config directory
cd ~/.claude

# Backup existing skills/agents (if any)
[ -d skills ] && mv skills skills.backup
[ -d agents ] && mv agents agents.backup

# Create symlinks to the repository
ln -s /path/to/skills/.claude/skills skills
ln -s /path/to/skills/.claude/agents agents

# Verify symlinks
ls -l skills agents
```

**Example with actual path:**
```bash
cd ~/.claude
ln -s ~/projects/skills/.claude/skills skills
ln -s ~/projects/skills/.claude/agents agents
```

#### Windows (Command Prompt - Run as Administrator)

```cmd
:: Navigate to Claude Code config directory
cd %USERPROFILE%\.claude

:: Backup existing skills/agents (if any)
if exist skills ren skills skills.backup
if exist agents ren agents agents.backup

:: Create symlinks to the repository
mklink /D skills C:\path\to\skills\.claude\skills
mklink /D agents C:\path\to\skills\.claude\agents

:: Verify symlinks
dir skills
dir agents
```

#### Windows (PowerShell - Run as Administrator)

```powershell
# Navigate to Claude Code config directory
cd $env:USERPROFILE\.claude

# Backup existing skills/agents (if any)
if (Test-Path skills) { Rename-Item skills skills.backup }

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Changes are immediately available in Claude Code (no restart needed)
```

### Troubleshooting Symlinks

**Permission Issues (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
# Ensure you have read permissions
chmod -R u+r /path/to/skills/.claude
```

**Permission Issues (Windows):**
- Ensure you're running Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
